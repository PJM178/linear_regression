# Multiple Linear Regression in R

This is a demo of multiple linear regression in R. A linear regression model is fit to a dateset containing various cars along with their specs. The aim is to predict miles per gallon statistic based on the relevant specs.

## Methodology and Data

The idea behind linear regression is that the dependent variable, the variable that we are trying to predict, is linearly dependent on some other variables, independent variables. For example, housing prices might be dependent on the squarefeet space of the house. Moreover, we can think many more variables on which the house price might depend on, such as the year it was build, its relative condition, its distance to the nearest city, neighborhood, last renovation year, etc. In the case there are multiple independent variables, the model is called multiple linear regression. The most common method to fit the line to the data is ordinary least squares. Loss function of the model minimizes the residual - true observation minus the point where the line passes - sum of squares to give the line that is closes to the data.
